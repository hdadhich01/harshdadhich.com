📰 I like building stuff that reduces inconvenience. Some of my projects are [SlugTools](https://api.slug.tools), [round-nutrition](https://pypi.org/project/round-nutrition/), and [Albert](https://github.com/hdadhich01/Albert). Right now, I'm working with ephys neural data under [Braingeneers](https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu) and performing data analytics through [CITRIS](https://citris-uc.org).

☀️ I'll be interning at [Intuitive](https://www.intuitive.com) in Sunnyvale, CA this summer!
